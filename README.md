#   Web Application of Data Visualization with Plotly Express

In this application we use the ‘Dash’ library  for web application and ‘Plotly Express’ for graphs .

#  Dash Library
Dash is built on the top of Plotly.js , React , Flask. Dash is the python frame work for building analytical web application. It enable you to build dashboards using pure python language. Dash is open source . We can run our application on web browser by using dash. Dash ties many UI elements like dropdowns, sliders and graphs directly to your analytical python code. 
Dash installation:
Run this command into your anaconda terminal 	
	
  pip install dash


#  Plotly Express
It is high level wrapper around plotly.py . Plotly express function uses graph objects and return graphs. This library is used for visualization of data to show in interactive graphs. It is high level declarative charting library.		
Plotly Express installation:
Run this command into your anaconda terminal 

	pip install plotly		

After installation you will run this code in order to visualization , we need to  move to the terminal and start terminal by typing the name of your file
	
	python app.py
  

#  Note:													
In this project the name of file is ‘app.py’ thats why we write this name , if your file name is project.py then you will write in terminal ‘ python project.py’	

This will start new web server at

	 http://127.0.0.1:8050/	
   
and you will see dashboard of my application
